## Pose Estimation
 * Currently we are using the following [repo](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) for pose estimation.
 * The code sits in a container inside an Amazon Ubuntu intance. (We have to set up a good way with which we may all access this intance.) 
 * Currently we can run the binary on videos and a get a Json string with the estimated poses. Soon functionality will be fully available throught (most likely) a python api.
